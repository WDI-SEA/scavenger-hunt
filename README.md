# Scavenger hunt

Let's do a little scavenger hunt to get familiar with some locations on campus. We'll find a bunch of lines of code, out of order and then reorder them to find the answer to a riddle.

Here's how it works:

#### 1. Use the riddles to determine where to go to get the next line of code

Each line of code you have will give you a riddle about how to get to the next line of code. This may include talking to people around campus or going to various locations on campus.

#### 2. Collect all 8 lines of code

We'll give you the first line to start out with below!

#### 3. Put the lines of code (in order) into a repl

Solve the riddle!

## Game Starter Code

Here is line 1: Save it!

```js
// Question: What happens when you send the signal? (Line 1 of 8)
```

And here is your riddle to find the next line of code:

```
When you're on campus and don't know what to do
These folks on campus are happy to give you a clue!
They do labels and lost and found and print requests too,
They have a line of code that's just for you!
```

Have fun! And ask your instructor if you get stuck and need a hint!
